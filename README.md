# hello-world

My name is David Stumpe, I have taken a couple programming classes in college.
Starting in September I will be attending a coding bootcamp called Skill Distillery.
I am really looking forward to this course.
I intend to put in all the work required to become a successful programmer.
I am ready to begin this journey and keep learning new stuff everyday.
